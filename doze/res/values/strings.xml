    <string name="doze_settings_help_text">These features use sensor events to launch a doze notification pulse. The chosen sensor is only enabled when the device receives a notification, this helps to reduce battery usage. There is also an option to enable the chosen sensor as soon as the screen turns off, this will cause higher battery usage.\n\nNOTE: The proximity sensor gestures may break deep sleep completely. Use them with caution.</string>
